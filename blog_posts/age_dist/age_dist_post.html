<title>Age and Gender Distributions</title>
</head>

<body>




<p>In <a href="http://selfiecity.net">selfiecity</a> and a previous <a href = "http://lab.softwarestudies.com/2014/02/gender-age-and-ambiguity-of-selfies-on.html">post</a>, we showed that Moscow has a dramatic number of female selfies. To be more precise, you are 4 times less likely to find a male selfie from Moscow than any of the other five cities that we looked at. In this post we are going to ask if this trend holds for different age groups.</p>

<p>First, let's look again at the distribution of selifes partition by gender for the different cities:</p>

<div class="chunk" id="unnamed-chunk-2"><div class="rimage default"><img src="figure/unnamed-chunk-2.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-2" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-2" class="plot" /></div></div>


<p>The plot shows  the number of selfie photos by city, gender and age
group. A few things stand our in the plot (do you see other
interesting patterns). Right away, we can see more patterns which were
hidden when we only compared number of selfies for cities and genders,
without separating into age groups.</p>

<p>In the upper part, we plot numbers of female and male selfies for
youngest Instagram users (< 17). We see a strong differences between
our cities located in Asia (Bangkok and Tokyo) and outside (New York,
Moscow, Berlin). in the first two cities, there are many more selfies
of young females, while in Western cities the numbers of male and
females are almost the same. And the numbers of female selfies in
Bangkok and Tokyo are also disproportionally large in comparison to
all other groups in this age category.</p>

<p>What happens when we consider the next age group - 17 to 24? Tokyo and
Bangkok retain their strong positions, with significantly more female
selfies in these two cities than the cities in the west. But now,
Moscow shoots out way ahead - there are XX % female selfies from
Moscow in this age group vs. XX % from Tokyo and XX % from Bangkok.
And now the unusual pattern which we included in our findings
presented in selfiecity.net is even more visible - there are XX as
many female selfies in Moscow than male selfies. Thats a huge
difference!</p>

<p>In the next age group (24-32), Moscow is still leading, and it still
has the largest difference in numbers betwen female and male selfies.
The other city which also has a significant difference in this respect
is NYC, but its not as strong as in Moscow.</p>

<p>Finally, lets look at the last group (32-65). Here we see that the
pattern which was present in all other age groups - more female
selfies than male selfies for every city - is reversed. In our oldest
group, in every city now there are more males than females. But Moscow
is again an exeption - here we stlll find more female selfies than
male selfies. Either Moscow males are too busy working to post
selfies, or Moscow female just like to take their pictures at all ages
- either way, its data again looks different than data from other
cities.</p>
<p>
Now, you may remember from the results we reported in selfiecity that
most selfies in our dataset are from 23-25 age category. Since in the
graph above this category was broken into two, lets not break data
differently, so we can have 23-25 olds in one group.</p>
